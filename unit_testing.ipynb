    "# CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence - Assignment 4 - Decision Trees and Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Machine learning offers a number of methods for classifying data into discrete categories, such as k-means clustering. Decision trees provide a structure for such categorization, based on a series of decisions that led to separate distinct outcomes. In this assignment, you will work with decision trees to perform binary classification according to some decision boundary. Your challenge is to build and to train decision trees capable of solving useful classification problems. You will learn first how to build decision trees, then how to effectively train them and finally how to test their performance.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### The Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You will only have to edit and submit **_decision_trees_submission.py_**, but there are a number of notable other files:\n",
    "1. **_decision_trees_submission.py_**: Where you will build your decision tree, confusion matrix, performance metrics, forests, and do the vectorization warm up.\n",
    "2. **_decision_trees_submission_tests.py_**: Sample tests to validate your trees, learning, and vectorization locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Datasets\n",
    "1. **_part23_data.csv_**: 4 features, 1372 data points, binary classification (last column)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **_challenge_train.csv_**:  30 features, 6636 datapoints, binary classification (first column)\n",
    "3. **_challenge_test.csv_**: (will not be provided, but will be similarly structured as challenge_train with 40% of the datapoints)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment 5 warmup\n",
    "4. **_vectorize.csv_**: data used during the vectorization warmup for Assignment 5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "**NOTE:** We are only allowing four imports: __ future__.division, numpy, collections.Counter and time. We will be checking to see if any other libraries are used. You are not allowed to use any outside libraries especially for part 4 (challenge). Please remember that you should not change any function headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Assignment\n",
    "Classification is used widely in machine learning to figure out how to sort new data that comes through.  You will build, train and test decision tree models to perform basic classification tasks. Students should understand how decision trees and random forests work. This will help you develop an intuition for how and why accuracy differs for training and testing data based on different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "For this assignment we're going to need an explicit way to make structured decisions. The `DecisionNode` class will be used to represent a decision node as some atomic choice in a binary decision graph. We would only use this implementation of the Decision Tree for this assignment and any other implementations will be checked against and denied credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object from the 'DecisionNode' can represent a class label (i.e. a final decision) or a binary decision to guide us through a flow-chart to arrive at a decision. Note that in this representation 'True' values for a decision take us to the left. This choice is arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# HOW TO USE THIS NOTEBOOK\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook is meant to help structure your coding for the assignment, all it does is align the relevant tests for each section in a convenient format. Code Changes should still be made in decision_trees_submission.py. This notebook *should* dynamically reload your file for each test (please let us know if it doesnt). You do not need to submit this notebook, nor do you need to use it if you prefer running the unit tests from the command line. Remember to read the unit tests to understand what you are passing.\n",

    "1. Check for base cases:\n",
    "   1. If all elements of a list are of the same class, return a leaf node with the appropriate class label.\n",
    "   2. If a specified depth limit is reached, return a leaf labeled with the most frequent class.\n",
    "2. For each attribute alpha: evaluate the normalized gini gain gained by splitting on attribute `alpha`.\n",
    "3. Let `alpha_best` be the attribute with the highest normalized gini gain.\n",
    "4. Create a decision node that splits on `alpha_best`.\n",
    "5. Repeat on the sublists obtained by splitting on `alpha_best`, and add those nodes as children of this node\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in the `DecisionTree.__build_tree__()` method implement the above algorithm.\n",
    "Next, in `DecisionTree.classify()`, write a function to produce classifications for a list of features once your decision tree has been built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other helpful notes:\n",
    "1. Your features and classify should be in numpy arrays where if the dataset is (_m_ x _n_) then the features is (_m_ x _n-1_) and classify is (_m_ x _1_)\n",
    "2. These features are continuous features and you will need to split based on a threshold.\n",

    "1. We load **_part23_data.csv_** and create our cross-validation training and test set with a `k=10` folds.  We use our own `generate_k_folds()` method.\n",
